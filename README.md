# Airbnb Dataset Analysis Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Dataset Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze the Airbnb Dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the platform, including pricing dynamics, host performance, and guest experiences. 

## Overview

The Airbnb Dataset comprises 87,946 rows of booking data collected from the platform. Our analysis focuses on exploring this dataset to answer key questions such as:

- Which neighborhoods exhibit the largest differences in average prices between superhosts and non-superhosts?
- What aspects of guest experiences (e.g., cleanliness, communication) are most strongly correlated with listing prices?
- How do pricing strategies vary between professional hosts (those managing listings in multiple locations) and non-professional hosts?

## Objectives

1. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the Airbnb Dataset.
2. Identify trends and patterns within the data related to pricing, host performance, and guest experiences.
3. Provide actionable insights for hosts and guests to enhance their experiences on the Airbnb platform.

## Methodology

Our analysis involves:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing key features of the dataset.
- Statistical analysis: Calculating correlations and conducting hypothesis testing to uncover relationships within the data.
- Interpretation: Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis results.

## Usage

To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:
1. Download the Airbnb Dataset (provide link if available).
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.
3. Explore the results and draw your own conclusions.
